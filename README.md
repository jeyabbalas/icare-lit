# iCARE-Lit web application

This repository demonstrates how to use [Wasm-iCARE](https://github.com/jeyabbalas/wasm-icare) to build [findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36804665/) web applications for estimating absolute risk of an outcome of interest. Specifically, the demonstrated web application here develops and deploys the [iCARE-Lit model](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31165158/), a literature-based model to estimate the 5-year absolute risk of breast cancer.

The web application is live at: https://jeyabbalas.github.io/icare-lit/
